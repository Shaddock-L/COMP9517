## 2. How to run this program:
### Due to the size limit, we cannot include the test images into the submit file. You need to put the test images into the current directory **AND** modify the path variable in the **25th and 26th** lines in main.py.   <br> RUN ```python3(or python if you run this on windows) main.py```.      <br>Then you will see a new window, here are some options for you:   <br> (a). Press ```E``` to **hide**/**show** the group rectangles.  <br>(b). Press ```White Space``` or ```Enter```, the video will freeze and you can select a ROI on another window which shows the current frame image. After selecting the ROI, press ```White Space``` again and switch back to the first window, the video starts playing now and the ROI will be shown in the video.
